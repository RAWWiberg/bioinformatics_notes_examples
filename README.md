This repository contains a small portfolio of examples of my bioinformatics notes and pipelines.

## 1. Macrostomum genome assembly and annotation

These notes form the backbone of my analyses for the publication:

Wiberg et al. 2021. G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics. 13: jkad 149. [LINK](https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkad149)

The repository mirrors parts of the main [Zenodo archive](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7861769 ) in a more accessible way.

The organisation of the project pipeline is described and accessed in the project README:

[Macrostomum genomes README](./macrostomum_genomes/README.md)


For this project I developed a novel approach ... which is detailed in a separate github archive

[IsoSeq rarefaction](https://github.com/RAWWiberg/isoseq_rarefaction)


Finally, for this project I established an in-house genome browser using JBrowse and sequenceserver.
This browser is not accessible to the public, but I detail my approach with a separate notebook

## 2. Callosobruchus maculatus experimental evolution and gene expression

These notes are from my analyses for the publication:

Wiberg et al. 2025. Mol. Biol. Evol. 42: msaf178. [LINK](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/42/8/msaf178/8217438)

The repository mirrors parts of the main [Zenodo archive](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13919165) in a more accessible way.

The organisation of the project pipeline is described and accessed in the project README:

[C. maculatus gene expression study README](./callosobruchus_maculatus_gene_expression/README.md)
